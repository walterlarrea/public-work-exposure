    <p>
      Hello! I'm Walter, and I'm based in Uruguay, looking forward to work in the IT industry.
      I am eager to develop software and make the difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      After typing my first lines of code at the age of sixteen, I fell in love with programming and have wanted to work in coding ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was nineteen, I was still studying Computer Science in high school and using all my spare time trying to code anything I could.
      I created simple C programs, some VB.NET school assignments, and even did some 'freelance' work creating little .LUA scripts for games.
    </p>
    <p>
      These days, I spend most of my free time studying, practicing, and gaining hands-on experience.
      I'm taking every opportunity to improve my technical and soft skills, while also learning about the software development processes.
