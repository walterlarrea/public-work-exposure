      Hello! I'm Walter, and I'm based in Uruguay, looking forward to landing a job in the IT industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      After typing my first lines of code at the age of sixteen, I fell in love with programming and have wanted to work in coding ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was nineteen, I was still studying Computer Science in high school and using all my spare time trying to code anything I could.
      I created simple C programs, some VB.NET school assignments, and even did some 'freelance' work creating little .LUA scripts for games.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I then became confused about studying and personal stuff, so I decided to get a job and start living independently.
      A couple of years later, I found myself programming again while finishing high school and exploring new opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      These days, I spend most of my free time studying, practicing, and gaining hands-on experience in IT.
      I'm taking every opportunity to improve my technical and soft skills while also learning about the software development process.
      Whenever I incorporate new knowledge into my work or deliver a Git push to my repositories, I feel a rush of motivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently, I completed a Front-end Web development course that covered vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS.
      From there, I took the time to understand some key features of JavaScript, and dove into React, MongoDB, Node, and Express.
      So my focus right now is on the MERN stack, but mostly within the JS ecosystem given its flexibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, I am excited to continue learning and growing as a developer,
      and I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to a team or organization that values innovation,
      collaboration, and continuous improvement.
    </p>
